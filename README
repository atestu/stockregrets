StockRegrets
============

StockRegrets is a small webapp written in Ruby using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/). This is my first project in Ruby so my code is probably atrocious. 

"Quick and dirty" is an appropriate expression to describe the development process.

I just wanted to create a simple application and deploy it really fast. It's hosted by [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), a service I strongly recommend.


Bugs & Stuff
------------

The application is far from complete at the moment, so if you find any bug (they're probably not hard to find), please contact me on twitter at [@stockregrets](http://twitter.com/stockregrets), or send me a message on GitHub.
